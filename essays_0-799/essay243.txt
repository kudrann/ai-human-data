 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. While there is no doubt that technology has revolutionized our lives in many ways, I believe that its effects are not entirely positive. 
On one hand, computers have made communication easier and more accessible than ever before. We can now connect with people from all corners of the world and exchange information at lightning speed. This has undoubtedly brought us closer together and expanded our knowledge of different cultures and lifestyles. Additionally, children can learn to use technology at an early age, which can help them develop essential skills such as hand-eye coordination and problem-solving.
However, there is also a darker side to the widespread use of computers. Many people have become addicted to their screens, spending hours each day surfing the internet or playing video games instead of engaging in physical activities or socializing with others. This has led to an increase in obesity rates and a decline in face-to-face communication skills. Furthermore, the rise of social media has been linked to increased levels of anxiety, depression, and loneliness among young people.
In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly brought many benefits to society, we must be mindful of their negative effects. It is essential to find a balance between embracing technology and maintaining our physical and mental well-being. We should encourage children to use computers as a tool rather than a source of entertainment, and adults should make an effort to limit their screen time and engage in more meaningful activities.
I hope that this letter has persuaded the readers to consider the effects of computers on society and take steps to use technology responsibly.
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
