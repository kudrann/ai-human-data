 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to express my thoughts on the impact of computers on society. While there is no denying that computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, I firmly believe that their effects are not entirely positive. 
On one hand, it is true that computers have made our lives easier in many ways. They allow us to perform complex calculations quickly, connect with people from all over the world, and access vast amounts of information at our fingertips. However, these advantages come at a cost. 
As more and more people become addicted to their screens, they are spending less time engaging in physical activities, socializing with friends and family, and enjoying the beauty of nature. This sedentary lifestyle has led to an increase in obesity, depression, and other health problems. 
Furthermore, the rise of social media and online gaming has created a generation of people who are isolated from reality and struggle with face-to-face communication. It is no wonder that we are seeing a decline in civility and empathy in our society. 
In conclusion, while computers have brought many benefits to society, we must also be aware of their negative effects. We need to find a balance between using technology and maintaining a healthy lifestyle, both physically and mentally. By doing so, we can ensure that the next generation is equipped with the skills needed to thrive in a rapidly changing world.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
