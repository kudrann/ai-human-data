 Dear Editor,
I am writing to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. As someone who has grown up in an era where technology is constantly advancing, I believe that computers have had a largely positive effect on people.
Firstly, computers teach hand-eye coordination and improve cognitive skills. With the rise of video games and interactive programs, children are able to develop their fine motor skills and problem-solving abilities in ways that were not possible before. Additionally, the internet provides access to a wealth of information, allowing people to learn about different cultures and languages from the comfort of their own homes.
Secondly, computers allow us to connect with others from all over the world. Social media platforms and online forums have made it easier than ever to communicate with people who share our interests or who are simply in different parts of the world. This global connection has helped to foster understanding and cooperation between cultures.
However, I also acknowledge that there are concerns about the effects of computers on society. Some people argue that we are spending too much time online and not enough time engaging with the real world. While I believe that a balance is necessary, I also think that technology can be used to enhance our experiences in nature and with loved ones. For example, we can use GPS tracking to explore new hiking trails or use video calls to stay connected with family members who live far away.
In conclusion, while there are certainly concerns about the effects of computers on society, I believe that their positive impact cannot be denied. By embracing technology and using it to enhance our lives rather than replace them, we can continue to benefit from the many advantages that computers provide. 
Sincerely,
[Your name]
