 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people and society as a whole. As someone who has grown up surrounded by technology, I firmly believe that computers have had a positive impact on our lives. 

Firstly, computers have revolutionized the way we learn and access information. The internet provides an endless wealth of knowledge at our fingertips, allowing us to expand our horizons and learn about different cultures and perspectives from around the world. Online courses and educational resources have also made it easier for people to learn new skills and advance their careers.

Secondly, computers have improved communication and brought people closer together. Social media platforms and messaging apps allow us to keep in touch with friends and family regardless of where they are in the world. Video calls enable us to see each other's faces and share experiences, even if we are physically distant.

However, I also understand the concerns raised by those who believe that computers have negative effects on our society. There is no denying that spending excessive amounts of time in front of a screen can lead to sedentary lifestyles and reduced social interaction. This is why it's essential for individuals to find a balance between their digital lives and real-life experiences.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have had a positive impact on society as they provide us with endless opportunities for learning and communication. By striking a balance between our online and offline activities, we can enjoy the benefits of technology while maintaining a healthy lifestyle and strong social connections. 

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]
