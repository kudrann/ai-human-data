 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects of computers on society. I believe that computers have had a positive impact on people and their daily lives.
Firstly, computers allow us to access information from all over the world in just a few clicks. This has made it easier for people to learn about different cultures and customs without leaving their homes. It has also opened up opportunities for communication and collaboration among individuals from different parts of the world.
Secondly, computers have revolutionized the way we work. With the help of software and applications, people can now work more efficiently and effectively. This has led to an increase in productivity and a decrease in the time required to complete tasks.
However, there are some concerns about the negative effects of computers on society. Some experts believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time engaging in physical activities. They also argue that computers can hinder social interaction and reduce face-to-face communication.
In conclusion, I believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh their drawbacks. With proper guidance and parental control, children can use computers to enhance their learning experience without neglecting other important aspects of life. As for adults, computers have made our lives easier and more convenient in many ways.
I hope that this letter has persuaded the readers to agree with me that computers have had a positive impact on society. Thank you for taking the time to read my opinion.
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
