 Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented rate, it has become a topic of debate whether or not computers have positive effects on society. While there are undoubtedly many benefits to using computers, such as improved access to information and increased efficiency in communication, I believe that their impact on people is largely negative.

One major concern is the effect of computers on physical health. With the rise of sedentary jobs and online entertainment, more and more people are spending hours sitting at their desks or in front of screens. This lack of movement leads to a host of health problems such as obesity, heart disease, and poor posture. In addition, excessive screen time has been linked to sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression.

Furthermore, computers have made it easier for people to become isolated from each other. With the rise of social media and online gaming, many individuals spend more time interacting with virtual friends than with those in their real lives. This can lead to a lack of empathy and social skills, as well as the erosion of meaningful relationships.

Another issue is the effect of computers on education. While technology has undoubtedly made learning more accessible, it has also led to a decrease in critical thinking and creativity. Students are increasingly reliant on search engines and online resources rather than engaging with the material themselves. This can lead to a lack of depth and understanding, as well as an over-reliance on digital sources.

In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly revolutionized many aspects of our lives, their impact on people must be carefully considered. We need to ensure that we are using technology in a way that promotes physical health, social connectedness, and critical thinking, rather than harming these important aspects of our lives.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
