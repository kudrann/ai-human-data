 Dear Editor,
As someone who has grown up with technology, I firmly believe that computers have had a positive impact on society. One of the most significant advantages is the ability to learn about different cultures and places without leaving your home. The internet provides access to an abundance of information, which can broaden our understanding and perspective of the world.
Moreover, computers have revolutionized communication, allowing people to connect with others from all corners of the globe instantly. This global connection has enabled people to form new relationships, do business together, and share ideas that could lead to groundbreaking innovations.
While it is true that excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, there are ways to balance technology usage with physical activity. For instance, people can take breaks to stretch or go for a walk, and incorporate fitness apps into their daily routine. 
In conclusion, the benefits of computers far outweigh any potential negatives. By embracing technology, we open ourselves up to endless opportunities for learning, growth, and connection. I urge our community to embrace the positive impact of computers on society and use them as a tool for personal and collective progress.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
