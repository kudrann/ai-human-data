 Dear [Newspaper],
As technology continues to advance, there has been an increase in the use of computers in our daily lives. While some may argue that this has had a negative impact on society, I believe that computers have numerous positive effects on people.
Firstly, computers teach hand-eye coordination, which is essential for many tasks in life. From typing to playing video games, people are constantly using their hands and eyes together to interact with the computer. This skill can be transferred to other areas of life, such as driving or playing sports.
Secondly, computers allow people to learn about faraway places and cultures that they may never have the opportunity to visit in person. With just a few clicks, individuals can explore different parts of the world and gain a better understanding and appreciation for diverse cultures. This can lead to increased empathy and tolerance towards others.
Finally, computers allow people to communicate with others from all over the world. Social media platforms and messaging apps have made it easy for people to connect with friends and family, as well as meet new people who share their interests. Online communication can be especially beneficial for those who may not have many social opportunities in their daily lives.
While there are certainly concerns about the amount of time people spend on computers and its impact on physical health, I believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh the negatives. By embracing technology and using it to connect with others and learn new things, we can create a more informed and understanding society.
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
