 Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. In my view, computers have revolutionized the way we live and have brought numerous benefits to our lives. 

Firstly, computers have made information readily available at our fingertips. With the internet, we can access a wealth of knowledge on any subject matter, from scholarly articles to instructional videos, and this has enabled people to learn new skills and expand their knowledge in ways that were unimaginable before. This has also helped break down geographical barriers, allowing us to communicate with people from different parts of the world, and broaden our understanding of diverse cultures.

Secondly, computers have improved efficiency in various aspects of our lives. For instance, online banking allows us to manage our finances easily without having to visit a physical bank, while online shopping has made it convenient for us to purchase goods from the comfort of our homes. In the workplace, computers have streamlined processes and increased productivity, allowing businesses to operate more efficiently.

However, I acknowledge that excessive use of computers can have negative effects on our well-being. Sitting in front of a computer for long hours can lead to health problems such as back pain and eye strain. Additionally, spending too much time online can lead to social isolation, as people become more engrossed in their screens than interacting with the people around them.

In conclusion, while computers have brought numerous benefits to society, it is essential to use them in moderation and not let them take over our lives. By striking a balance between our online and offline activities, we can enjoy the benefits of technology without compromising our health and social well-being. 

I hope that this letter has persuaded the readers to appreciate the positive effects of computers on society and to use them responsibly. 

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]
