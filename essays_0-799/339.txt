 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. I believe that computers have a positive effect on society and can bring many benefits to individuals.
Firstly, computers teach hand-eye coordination which is very important for developing fine motor skills in children. This skill is essential for tasks such as writing or using scissors. In addition, with the help of computers, people are able to learn about faraway places and cultures that they might not have had the opportunity to experience otherwise. This knowledge can broaden one's perspective and promote understanding between different groups of people.
Moreover, computers allow people to communicate with others from all over the world through social media or online forums. This ability to connect with others who share similar interests can be very rewarding and help individuals feel less isolated.
However, I understand that some experts have concerns about the potential negative effects of spending too much time on computers. It is true that excessive computer use can lead to a sedentary lifestyle and less time spent outdoors or with family and friends. But this problem can be addressed by setting reasonable limits on computer usage and encouraging individuals to engage in physical activities and social interactions.
In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers have a positive effect on people and bring many benefits to society. With proper guidance and balance in usage, we can reap the rewards of technology while maintaining a healthy lifestyle and strong connections with others.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
