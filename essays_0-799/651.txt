 Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this letter to share my thoughts on the impact of computers on society. As someone who has grown up surrounded by technology, I firmly believe that computers have had a positive effect on people.

Firstly, computers have revolutionized the way we learn and access information. With the internet, anyone can find information on any topic they are interested in within seconds. This has opened up a world of opportunities for people to expand their knowledge and interests. It also allows us to connect with people from all over the world, sharing ideas and experiences that would have been impossible to do so before.

Secondly, computers have improved communication among people. With email, social media platforms, and video conferencing software, it is now easier to keep in touch with friends and family members who live far away or even in different countries. This has helped to bridge the gap between people and kept them connected despite the distance.

However, there are some concerns about the impact of computers on society. Some experts believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. While I understand these concerns, I also believe that it is up to each individual to find a balance between technology use and other activities in their lives.

In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers have had a positive impact on society. They have opened up a world of opportunities for us to learn and connect with others. It is now up to us to use this technology responsibly and find a balance between our online and offline lives. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
