 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects computers have on people. As computers become more and more prevalent in our society, it is important for us to consider how they are impacting our lives.

On one hand, computers have undeniably revolutionized the way we live and work. They have made information easily accessible, allowing us to learn about faraway places and people, and they have also given us the ability to communicate with others from around the world. Additionally, children can develop their hand-eye coordination and problem-solving skills by using computers at an early age.

On the other hand, there are concerns that computers may be having negative effects on our society. People are spending more time sitting in front of screens, leading to a decrease in physical activity and an increase in sedentary lifestyles. Furthermore, many people are becoming isolated as they spend more time communicating online rather than engaging in face-to-face interactions with friends and family.

In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly brought many benefits to society, it is important for us to be aware of their potential drawbacks. We must strive to find a balance between using technology to improve our lives and maintaining our connections with the world around us.

I urge your readers to consider the impact that computers have on their own lives and to take steps to ensure that they are using technology in a way that benefits themselves and society as a whole.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
