 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. While it is true that computers have brought about significant advancements in technology and made our lives easier in many ways, there are concerns that cannot be ignored.

On one hand, computers have enabled us to communicate with people across the globe, access vast amounts of information at our fingertips, and perform tasks more efficiently. These benefits are undeniable. However, it is also crucial to consider the negative consequences of computer use. For instance, excessive computer usage has been linked to a decline in physical activity levels, leading to obesity and other health problems. Moreover, the reliance on computers for communication has led to social isolation, as people are more likely to interact with screens than with their family and friends.

In conclusion, it is essential to strike a balance between embracing technology and maintaining our physical and mental well-being. We must encourage people to use computers responsibly and not let them take over our lives. By doing so, we can harness the power of technology while also ensuring that it benefits society positively.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
