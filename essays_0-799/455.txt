 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my thoughts on the impact of computers on society. There is no doubt that technology has transformed our lives and made it easier for us to communicate and access information from anywhere in the world. However, I believe that the negative effects of excessive computer use have been overlooked by many people.

One of the main concerns about computers is their effect on physical health. People who spend long hours sitting at a desk working on a computer may develop back pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and other health problems. Exercise is essential for maintaining good health, but when we are glued to our screens all day, it becomes challenging to find time to exercise.

Another concern is the effect of computers on social interaction. While technology has made it easier to connect with people from different parts of the world, it has also led to a decline in face-to-face communication. People are spending more and more time online, which can lead to social isolation and loneliness.

I believe that we need to find a balance between using technology and maintaining our physical and mental wellbeing. We should take breaks from our computers throughout the day, spend more time outdoors, and prioritize face-to-face interactions with friends and family.

In conclusion, I urge readers to consider the potential negative effects of excessive computer use on their health and social lives. Let us make an effort to maintain a balanced relationship with technology and not let it consume our lives.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
