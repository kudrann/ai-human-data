 Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance, more and more people are turning to computers for both work and entertainment. While there is no doubt that computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, it's important to consider the potential negative effects they may have on our society.

On one hand, computers have undeniable benefits. They allow us to communicate with people from all over the world, teach hand-eye coordination, and give us access to a wealth of information that was once difficult or impossible to obtain. However, there are also concerns about the amount of time people spend on computers, leading to less physical activity, spending more time indoors, and decreased social interaction with family and friends.

In conclusion, while computers have brought many positive changes to our society, it's important that we remain mindful of their potential negative effects. It's up to each individual to find a balance between using technology responsibly and maintaining a healthy lifestyle full of physical activity and social interaction.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
