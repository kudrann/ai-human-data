 Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. As someone who has been using computers for over a decade, I firmly believe that they have had an overall positive effect on people's lives. 

To begin with, computers have made it easier for us to access information about any topic from anywhere in the world. This has given people the opportunity to learn about new cultures and languages, expanding their knowledge and understanding of different ways of life. Moreover, computer games help develop hand-eye coordination and problem-solving skills in children. 

In addition, computers have made communication more accessible than ever before. People can now connect with friends and family members from around the world through email, social media platforms, or video conferencing software. This has strengthened relationships that might otherwise have been lost due to distance or time constraints. 

However, it is essential to note that like any tool, computers must be used responsibly. Excessive use of technology can lead to physical inactivity, eye strain, and social isolation if people choose to spend more time online than engaging in real-life interactions. 

In conclusion, I believe that computers have significantly benefited society by providing us with unprecedented access to information and communication tools. By using them wisely, we can harness their potential while avoiding the negative consequences of overuse.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
