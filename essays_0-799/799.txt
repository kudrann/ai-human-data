 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to express my views on the impact of computers on society. While there is no denying that technology has revolutionized our lives and made many aspects easier for us, I believe that the negative effects outweigh the positive ones.
Firstly, with the advancement of technology, people have become more reliant on computers, leading to a sedentary lifestyle. This has resulted in health issues such as obesity, diabetes and heart diseases. Additionally, spending excessive time online can also lead to social isolation, depression and anxiety.
Moreover, the rise of technology has also led to job displacement, with many traditional jobs becoming automated. This has resulted in a growing unemployment rate, particularly among the less skilled population.
Despite these negative impacts, there is still hope for us to turn things around. By promoting healthy habits such as exercising and spending time outdoors, we can combat the sedentary lifestyle that computers impose on us. Additionally, governments and businesses must work together to create new job opportunities and re-skill workers for the changing job market.
In conclusion, while technology has brought about many benefits, it is essential to recognize its negative effects and take action to mitigate them. By doing so, we can ensure that our society continues to progress while maintaining a healthy and balanced lifestyle.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
