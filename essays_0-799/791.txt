 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. While there is no doubt that technology has revolutionized our lives in many ways, I believe that it has both positive and negative effects on people.
On one hand, computers have made our lives easier by providing us with instant access to information, connecting us with people from all over the world, and allowing us to perform tasks more efficiently. However, on the other hand, excessive use of computers can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, social isolation, and even addiction.
Moreover, the widespread use of technology has led to the loss of many traditional skills and crafts, which are important for maintaining cultural heritage. It is also true that not everyone has equal access to technology, which can widen the digital divide and create inequality in society.
In conclusion, while computers have brought numerous benefits to our lives, we must also be aware of their potential negative effects. We need to find a balance between embracing technology and maintaining our traditional values and lifestyles. By doing so, we can harness the full potential of computers while minimizing their negative impact on society.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
