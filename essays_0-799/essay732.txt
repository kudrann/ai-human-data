 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to express my thoughts on the effects of computers on society. As someone who has grown up with technology, I firmly believe that computers have had a positive impact on our lives.
Firstly, computers have revolutionized the way we learn and access information. With the internet, people can easily find information on any topic they are interested in. This has opened up countless opportunities for learning and exploration. It is also easier to communicate with people from different parts of the world, which helps us understand different cultures and build relationships.
Secondly, computers have made our lives more convenient. For example, we can shop online, pay bills, and manage our finances without leaving our homes. This has saved us time and effort that would otherwise be spent on physical tasks.
However, there are concerns that people are spending too much time on their computers and not enough time engaging in physical activities or socializing with others. While this is a valid concern, I believe it can be addressed through education and awareness. Parents and teachers can encourage children to strike a balance between technology use and other activities.
In conclusion, while there may be some negative effects of computers on society, the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. With responsible usage and proper guidance, we can harness the power of technology to improve our lives and build a better future.
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
