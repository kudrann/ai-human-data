 Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented rate, the impact of computers on society has become a topic of much debate. While there are certainly many benefits to the widespread use of computers, it is crucial that we consider the potential drawbacks as well. 

On one hand, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, learn and work. They provide us with instant access to vast amounts of information and allow us to connect with people from all over the world. This has undoubtedly made our lives easier in many ways, as we are no longer limited by geographical boundaries or time zones. 

However, there is a growing concern that our increasing reliance on computers may be having negative effects on our physical and mental health. For instance, spending hours each day in front of a screen can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can result in obesity and other health problems. Additionally, the constant barrage of information and stimuli provided by computers can lead to addiction and social isolation. 

In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly brought many benefits to society, it is important that we remain mindful of their potential drawbacks. By striking a balance between our use of technology and our engagement with the world around us, we can ensure that the computers continue to enrich our lives rather than hinder them.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
