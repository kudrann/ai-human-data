 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to express my thoughts on the effects of computers on society. As technology advances, more and more people are using computers in their daily lives. While some argue that this has negative consequences, I believe that computers have a positive impact on our lives.
Firstly, computers allow us to learn about faraway places and cultures that we might not have been able to experience otherwise. With the internet, anyone can access information from all over the world, broadening our horizons and making us more knowledgeable about different cultures. This can lead to a greater understanding of others and promote peace and tolerance.
Secondly, computers teach hand-eye coordination and improve cognitive skills. Many educational games and programs are designed to help children develop these skills, which can be beneficial in other areas of their lives as well.
Finally, computers allow us to communicate with people from all over the world. Online communities and social media platforms have brought people together who might not have had the opportunity to meet otherwise. This can lead to new friendships and a greater sense of community.
However, I also recognize that too much time spent on computers can be detrimental. It is important for us to balance our screen time with other activities such as exercise, spending time outdoors, and socializing with friends and family.
In conclusion, while there are negative aspects to the use of computers, I believe that their positive effects outweigh them. By promoting education, communication, and understanding, computers can benefit society in a variety of ways. 
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
