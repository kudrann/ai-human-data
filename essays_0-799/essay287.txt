 Dear Editor,

I am writing to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people, particularly their impact on society. In recent years, technology has advanced at a rapid pace, and more and more people are using computers in their daily lives. While there is no doubt that computers have brought numerous benefits, I believe that they also have some negative consequences.

On the positive side, computers have made our lives much easier. They help us stay connected with friends and family members who live far away, provide access to a wealth of information on any topic imaginable, and allow us to work more efficiently. Additionally, children can learn important skills such as hand-eye coordination by playing video games or using educational software.

However, there is also evidence that suggests that excessive computer use can have negative effects on our health and wellbeing. For example, spending too much time in front of a screen can lead to weight gain, eye strain, and other physical problems. Moreover, computers can be addictive, and some people find it difficult to tear themselves away from their screens even though they should be spending more time on other activities such as exercise or socializing with others.

In conclusion, while computers have brought numerous benefits to society, we must also recognize that they have some negative consequences. It is important for us to strike a balance between using technology responsibly and enjoying the many other aspects of life that are equally important. I hope that more people will take this issue seriously and work towards finding a solution that benefits everyone involved.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
