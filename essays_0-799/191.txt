 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on our society. While there is no denying that computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, I believe that their effects are not entirely positive.

On one hand, computers have made our lives easier in many ways. They have given us access to a wealth of information at our fingertips, allowing us to learn about any topic quickly and easily. Additionally, they have improved communication and connectivity, making it possible for people all over the world to stay in touch with each other.

However, I am concerned that computers are causing us to become more isolated from the real world. With so much focus on screens and keyboards, we are spending less time engaging in physical activities and interacting with others face-to-face. This can lead to social isolation, lack of exercise, and other health problems.

Moreover, the rise of technology has also created a digital divide, where those who do not have access to computers or the internet are left behind in our increasingly digital society. This creates inequality and exacerbates existing social inequalities.

In conclusion, while computers have brought many benefits to society, we must also be aware of their potential negative effects. We need to strike a balance between embracing technology and maintaining our connections with the real world and each other. By doing so, we can ensure that computers continue to enhance our lives without harming us in the process.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
