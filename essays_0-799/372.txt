 Dear Editor,
I am writing to express my strong belief that computers have had an overwhelmingly positive effect on society. While it is true that some individuals may spend too much time in front of their screens, this can be said about any technology or activity if not used in moderation. 
One of the most significant benefits of computers is their ability to connect people from all corners of the world. Social media platforms and instant messaging applications have made it possible for friends and family members to communicate with each other instantly, no matter where they are. This has led to stronger relationships and a better understanding of different cultures and lifestyles.
Another advantage of computers is their educational value. Children can learn about virtually any subject through interactive computer programs that engage their senses and make learning fun. Adults can also take advantage of online courses and tutorials to improve their skills or pursue new interests. 
Computers have also revolutionized the way we work, making it possible for people to work from home or remotely. This has allowed many individuals to achieve a better work-life balance and spend more time with their families.
In conclusion, while there are some concerns about the potential negative effects of computer use, the benefits far outweigh any drawbacks. Computers have brought us closer together, expanded our knowledge, and improved our quality of life. I encourage your readers to embrace technology and use it as a tool for personal growth and development.
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
