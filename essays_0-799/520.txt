 Dear [Newspaper],

As technology advances, it's undeniable that computers play an increasingly significant role in our daily lives. While many people argue that these devices have positive effects on society, I believe that they can also have negative consequences.

On one hand, computers offer numerous benefits. They help us learn about different cultures and places, teach hand-eye coordination, and even enable us to communicate with others online. However, it's essential to consider the potential drawbacks of our growing reliance on technology.

Some experts express concern that people are spending too much time on their computers, leading to a sedentary lifestyle and less time spent enjoying nature or engaging in physical activities. Additionally, as we become more dependent on digital communication, we may lose the value of face-to-face interactions with family and friends.

In conclusion, while computers offer many advantages, it's crucial to maintain a balanced approach to technology use. We must remember the importance of physical activity, social interaction, and time spent outdoors. By recognizing these potential negative effects, we can work towards a healthier relationship with our digital devices and ensure that they continue to benefit society in positive ways.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
