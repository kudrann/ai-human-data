 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects of computers on people. I believe that computers have a positive impact on society and can benefit us in many ways. 
Firstly, computers have revolutionized the way we learn and access information. With the internet, people can easily access information about any subject from anywhere in the world. This has made education more accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or financial status. People can also take online courses and learn new skills that can help them advance in their careers. 
Secondly, computers have improved communication between people. With email, social media platforms, and instant messaging, people can easily connect with others from anywhere in the world. This has made it easier for families to stay in touch with each other, even if they live far apart. It has also allowed people to make new friends and expand their social circles. 
Lastly, computers have improved our productivity and efficiency. With software like Microsoft Office, people can easily create documents, spreadsheets, and presentations. This has made it easier for businesses to operate more efficiently and for individuals to manage their personal finances. 
Despite these benefits, there are some concerns about the effects of computers on society. Some experts worry that people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising or interacting with others in person. While this is a valid concern, I believe that it can be easily addressed by setting limits on computer use and encouraging people to balance their screen time with other activities. 
In conclusion, I strongly believe that computers have had a positive impact on society and have helped us in many ways. By embracing technology, we can continue to benefit from its advancements while also addressing any concerns that may arise. 
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
