 Dear Editor,

As technology continues to advance, computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. While there is no doubt that they offer numerous benefits, it is essential to consider their potential downsides as well. In this letter, I would like to share my thoughts on the effects of computers on people and persuade the readers to agree with me.

On one hand, computers have revolutionized the way we work, learn, and communicate. They provide us with access to a vast amount of information and enable us to connect with people from all over the world. Additionally, they offer countless opportunities for entertainment, such as playing games or watching movies. These benefits are undeniable and have made our lives easier in many ways.

However, there is also evidence to suggest that computers can have negative effects on our health and well-being. For instance, spending too much time in front of a computer can lead to physical problems such as eye strain, back pain, and obesity. Furthermore, excessive use of technology can result in social isolation, as people become more engaged with their screens and less connected with the world around them.

In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly transformed our lives for the better, it is crucial to strike a balance between using them to our advantage and avoiding their potential drawbacks. By being mindful of our computer use and making an effort to engage in other activities such as exercise, outdoor activities, and socializing, we can ensure that technology continues to benefit society positively.

I hope the readers will consider these points and join me in advocating for a responsible approach to computing.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
