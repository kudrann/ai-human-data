 Dear Editor,
I am writing to express my views on the impact of computers on society. As someone who has witnessed the rapid advancement of technology over the years, I firmly believe that computers have had a positive effect on people.
First and foremost, computers have revolutionized education. With the internet at our fingertips, we can access information on any topic from anywhere in the world. This has enabled students to learn about different cultures and languages, broadening their horizons and fostering a sense of understanding and empathy towards others.
Furthermore, computers have improved hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills, which are essential for activities such as typing, gaming, and graphic design. These skills are not only beneficial in the workplace but also help to improve cognitive abilities and problem-solving skills.
Lastly, social media and online communication platforms have made it easier for people to stay connected with family and friends, regardless of where they are in the world. This has helped to bridge the gap between cultures and foster a sense of global community.
However, I must also acknowledge that there are concerns about the negative effects of computers on society. People may spend too much time on their computers, leading to sedentary lifestyles and a lack of physical activity. It is essential to strike a balance between technology use and other activities such as exercise, enjoying nature, and spending time with loved ones.
In conclusion, I believe that computers have had a positive effect on people, providing us with opportunities for education, skill development, and social interaction. However, it is crucial to use technology responsibly and not let it take over our lives. 
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
