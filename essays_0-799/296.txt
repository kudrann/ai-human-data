 Dear Editor,
I am writing to express my thoughts on the impact of computers on society. As someone who has witnessed the evolution of technology over the years, I firmly believe that computers have had a positive effect on people. 
First and foremost, computers have revolutionized the way we learn and access information. The internet provides us with an endless pool of knowledge, allowing us to learn about any subject matter from anywhere in the world. This has broadened our horizons and made it possible for us to connect with people from different cultures and backgrounds.
Moreover, computers have also improved hand-eye coordination, as they require users to interact with screens using various input devices such as mice or touchpads. This has helped develop fine motor skills in children who play video games or use computer programs for educational purposes. 
However, I must also acknowledge the concerns raised by some experts about the potential negative effects of excessive computer usage. It is true that people may spend too much time on their computers and neglect other aspects of their lives such as physical exercise or social interactions. But this can be mitigated by setting boundaries for computer use and encouraging a balanced lifestyle. 
In conclusion, while there may be some drawbacks to using computers, the benefits they provide far outweigh the negatives. I urge the readers of this newspaper to embrace technology and use it as a tool to enhance our lives rather than letting it control us.
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
