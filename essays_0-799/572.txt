 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to share my thoughts on the impact of computers on society. As someone who has grown up in a world where technology is constantly advancing, I firmly believe that computers have had both positive and negative effects on people. 
On one hand, computers have revolutionized the way we live and work. They have made communication easier and faster than ever before, allowing us to connect with people from all corners of the world. Additionally, computers have provided us with access to an unlimited amount of information, which has opened up new opportunities for learning and exploration. Furthermore, they have improved our efficiency in many tasks such as writing, researching or even shopping. 
However, there are also some downsides to the widespread use of computers. For instance, people are spending more time sitting in front of screens than ever before, which has led to a rise in sedentary lifestyles and health problems such as obesity and eye strain. Additionally, the constant exposure to technology has made many people feel disconnected from nature and their surroundings. 
In conclusion, while computers have brought about significant improvements in our lives, it is essential that we use them responsibly. We must make an effort to strike a balance between embracing technology and maintaining our physical and mental well-being. I hope that by raising awareness of these issues, we can work towards creating a society where people are able to enjoy the benefits of computers while avoiding their negative consequences. 
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
