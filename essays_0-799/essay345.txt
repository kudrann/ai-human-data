 Dear Sir/Madam,
I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. I believe that computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, making our lives easier and more convenient. They have brought about significant changes in various fields, including communication, education, and business.
One of the most significant benefits of computers is their ability to connect people from different parts of the world. With the help of the internet, we can communicate with anyone, anywhere, at any time. This has made the world a smaller place and helped people to learn about different cultures and traditions.
Furthermore, computers have also revolutionized education. Online courses and educational resources have made it possible for people to learn from anywhere in the world. This has opened up new opportunities for people who cannot attend traditional classes due to geographical or financial constraints.
However, there are some concerns about the negative effects of computers on society. Some experts believe that people are spending too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. While this may be true for some individuals, it does not mean that computers should be banned or avoided altogether.
In conclusion, I believe that the benefits of computers far outweigh their drawbacks. They have made our lives easier, more convenient, and more connected. By using them wisely and in moderation, we can reap their many benefits while avoiding their negative effects. 
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
