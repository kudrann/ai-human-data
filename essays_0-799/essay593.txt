 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. As someone who has grown up with technology, I firmly believe that computers have had a positive effect on people.

First and foremost, computers allow us to learn about faraway places and cultures that we may not have access to otherwise. The internet provides an abundance of information at our fingertips, enabling us to broaden our knowledge and understanding of the world around us. This can only be seen as a good thing, as it promotes tolerance and appreciation for different ways of life.

Additionally, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate with one another. With social media platforms and messaging apps, people are now able to connect with friends and family across the globe instantly. This has brought us closer together as a global community, allowing us to share our experiences and learn from each other's cultures.

Furthermore, computers have also improved our productivity and efficiency in various areas of life. From online banking to shopping, everything is now at our fingertips, making our lives much easier and more convenient. This has allowed us to save time and energy, which can be spent on other important aspects of life such as physical activity and spending time with loved ones.

Despite these benefits, there are some concerns about the overuse of computers and the impact it may have on our physical and mental health. However, this is a problem that can be easily solved by setting boundaries and balancing our use of technology with other important aspects of life.

In conclusion, I firmly believe that computers have had a positive effect on people. They have provided us with opportunities to learn, connect, and improve our lives in countless ways. While there may be some concerns about overuse, these can be easily addressed by using technology responsibly.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]
