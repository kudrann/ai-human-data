 Dear [Newspaper],
As technology continues to advance, more and more people are turning to computers for their daily needs. While there are certainly benefits to this technological revolution, it is important that we do not overlook the potential negative effects it may have on society.
One of the main arguments in favor of computers is that they provide a wealth of information at our fingertips. With just a few clicks, we can learn about any topic under the sun and connect with people from all corners of the globe. However, this convenience comes at a cost. Too many people are spending hours each day in front of their computers, neglecting other aspects of their lives such as physical exercise, time spent outdoors, and social interaction with family and friends.
It is true that computers can teach hand-eye coordination and provide opportunities for learning and communication. However, it is also important that we maintain a healthy balance in our lives and not allow ourselves to become too dependent on technology. We must remember that there is more to life than what we can find online.
In conclusion, while computers have many benefits, we must be mindful of their potential negative effects. Let us strive for a balanced lifestyle that includes both the convenience of technology and the richness of real-life experiences.
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
