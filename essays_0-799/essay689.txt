 Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing this letter to express my views on the impact of computers on society. As we all know, computers have become an integral part of our lives and have changed the way we communicate, work, and live. While there are many benefits to using computers, I believe that they also have some negative effects that should be addressed.

Firstly, I believe that computers have greatly improved communication and access to information. With the internet, people can connect with others from all over the world and share ideas and experiences. This has led to a greater understanding of different cultures and ways of life. However, this also means that people are spending more time on their computers and less time interacting with others in person. This can lead to social isolation and a lack of face-to-face communication skills.

Secondly, I believe that the use of computers has led to a sedentary lifestyle for many people. With the rise of online gaming and social media, people are spending more time sitting in front of their screens than engaging in physical activities. This can lead to health problems such as obesity and poor posture.

In conclusion, while computers have brought many benefits to society, they also have some negative effects that should be addressed. We need to find a balance between using technology to improve our lives and maintaining our social connections and physical health. I urge the readers of this newspaper to consider these issues and take action to ensure that we use technology in a responsible and healthy manner.

Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
