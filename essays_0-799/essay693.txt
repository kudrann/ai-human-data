 Dear [Newspaper],

I am writing this letter to express my thoughts on the impact of technology, specifically computers, on society today. As more and more people become reliant on computers for work, communication, and entertainment, it is crucial to understand the effects that these devices have on our daily lives.

Those who support advances in technology argue that computers have had a positive effect on people. They teach hand-eye coordination, provide access to information about distant places and cultures, and even allow people to communicate with others from all over the world. I agree with these points; the ability to connect with individuals globally has led to increased understanding and collaboration between different cultures.

However, some experts are concerned that people are spending too much time on their computers, leading to a decrease in physical activity, time spent outdoors, and social interaction. I believe this is a valid concern. While technology can enhance our lives, it should not replace essential aspects of our well-being such as exercise, nature, and human connection.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have both positive and negative effects on society. They provide us with valuable information and opportunities for communication; however, we must be mindful of the potential consequences of relying too heavily on technology. It is essential to maintain a balance between our digital and natural lives, ensuring that we do not sacrifice our well-being in pursuit of convenience and entertainment.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
