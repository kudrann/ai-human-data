 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of technology, specifically computers, on society. As we know, computers are becoming increasingly common in households and workplaces around the world. While there are certainly benefits to using computers, I believe that they also have negative effects on people, particularly in terms of our physical and mental well-being.

On the one hand, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate and access information. With the internet, people can learn about different cultures and connect with others from all corners of the world. This has opened up new opportunities for collaboration and education. However, this also means that we spend more time indoors in front of screens instead of enjoying nature or engaging in physical activities.

Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that excessive computer use can lead to a number of health problems such as eye strain, back pain, and obesity. With the rise of sedentary jobs and online gaming, it is becoming more difficult for people to maintain an active lifestyle.

In conclusion, while computers have brought many benefits to society, we must also consider the potential negative effects on our well-being. I urge readers to strike a balance between using technology and enjoying other aspects of life such as spending time with loved ones and engaging in physical activities. By doing so, we can ensure that computers enhance rather than hinder our lives.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
