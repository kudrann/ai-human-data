 Dear Editor of [Newspaper Name],
I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. In recent years, the use of technology has increased dramatically, and it has had a significant effect on our lives. 
On one hand, computers have revolutionized the way we communicate, learn, and work. They have made it possible for us to connect with people from all over the world, access vast amounts of information at our fingertips, and streamline our daily tasks. Moreover, computers have also improved our technical skills and have provided an excellent platform for individuals to showcase their creativity through various software applications. 
However, on the other hand, there are concerns that computers may be having negative effects on society. Many people spend hours in front of their screens, leading sedentary lifestyles and neglecting physical activity. Additionally, excessive use of technology can lead to social isolation as people become more engrossed in their virtual worlds, neglecting real-life relationships. 
In my view, the benefits of computers far outweigh their drawbacks. With proper guidance and regulation, we can minimize the negative effects and maximize the positive ones. For instance, schools and workplaces can encourage physical exercise and promote a healthy work-life balance. Parents can also monitor their children's computer usage to ensure that they are not becoming addicted to technology. 
In conclusion, I believe that computers have significantly improved our lives in many ways and will continue to do so in the future. We just need to use them responsibly and make sure we don't let them take over our lives. 
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
