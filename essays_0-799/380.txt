 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. While there is no doubt that computers have revolutionized the way we live and work, I believe that they also have some negative effects on people's lives. 

On one hand, computers have made our lives easier in many ways. They allow us to communicate with people all over the world, access information quickly, and perform complex tasks with ease. However, these advances come at a cost. Many people spend hours each day sitting in front of their computers, leading sedentary lifestyles that can lead to obesity and other health problems. Additionally, the internet has made it easier for people to become isolated from one another, as they spend more time interacting with screens than with real human beings.

Furthermore, there is a growing concern about the effects of technology on our mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of computers and other digital devices can lead to anxiety, depression, and other psychological disorders. This is because these devices are designed to stimulate our brains in ways that can be addictive, leading us to spend more time online than we should.

In conclusion, while computers have undoubtedly brought many benefits to society, we must also recognize their potential negative effects. It is up to each individual to strike a balance between using technology responsibly and maintaining a healthy lifestyle. By doing so, we can ensure that the digital age continues to enhance our lives without causing harm.

Yours sincerely,
[Your Name]
