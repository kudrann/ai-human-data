 Dear Editor,
I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the impact of computers on society. As someone who has grown up with technology, I firmly believe that computers have had a positive effect on people.
Firstly, computers teach hand-eye coordination and improve cognitive skills. With the rise of video games and simulations, people can improve their reaction time and problem-solving abilities while enjoying themselves. Additionally, computers allow us to learn about different cultures and places around the world that we may never have the chance to visit otherwise.
Furthermore, the ability to communicate with people from all over the globe has been a game-changer in terms of social interactions. With the help of technology, people can maintain relationships with family members who live far away or meet new friends online.
However, I also understand that there are concerns regarding the excessive use of computers and its effects on physical health and social interaction. It is essential to find a balance between using technology for our benefit while not neglecting other aspects of life such as exercise, spending time outdoors, and nurturing relationships with family and friends.
In conclusion, I believe that computers have had a positive impact on society, but it is crucial to use them responsibly and maintain a well-rounded lifestyle.
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
