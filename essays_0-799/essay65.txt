 Dear Editor,
As technology continues to advance at an unprecedented rate, it's no surprise that computers have become an integral part of our daily lives. While there are certainly advantages to using computers, I believe that their widespread use has a negative impact on society as a whole.
For one thing, computers can be extremely addictive. With the rise of social media and online gaming, people are spending more time in front of screens than ever before, often at the expense of other activities like exercise or face-to-face interactions with others. This sedentary lifestyle has been linked to a host of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and depression.
Furthermore, computers have made it easier for people to avoid confronting difficult issues in their lives. Instead of having tough conversations or taking action to address problems, many individuals turn to the internet for distraction or escape. This can lead to a lack of emotional growth and maturity, as well as a failure to develop important interpersonal skills.
Finally, computers have changed the way we communicate with one another. While it's certainly convenient to be able to send emails or instant messages from anywhere in the world, this has also led to a decline in face-to-face interactions and an increasing disconnection from our communities. People are becoming more isolated, and our society is suffering as a result.
In conclusion, while computers may offer some advantages, I believe that their widespread use has had a negative impact on our society. It's time for us to start taking steps towards a more balanced approach to technology, one that recognizes its benefits while also acknowledging its potential dangers. 
Sincerely,
[Your Name]
