 Dear Editor,
As computers become increasingly integrated into our daily lives, it is natural for people to have different opinions about their impact on society. While some believe that technology has only positive effects, others express concerns about its potential negative consequences. In my view, computers do benefit society in numerous ways, and I will attempt to persuade the readers of this opinion through this letter.
Firstly, computers have revolutionized the way we learn and access information. With the internet, people can easily find information on any topic they are interested in. This has expanded our knowledge and understanding of the world around us. Furthermore, children can now learn computer programming and other digital skills at a young age, which will be essential for their future careers.
Secondly, computers have made communication easier and more accessible. With email, social media, and video conferencing, people can stay in touch with friends and family members who live far away or in different countries. This has helped to bridge the gaps between people and strengthened relationships that would otherwise be difficult to maintain.
Finally, computers have also improved our productivity and efficiency at work. With the help of software applications, we can now perform complex tasks quickly and accurately, which saves us time and effort. In addition, remote working has become possible due to advances in technology, allowing people to work from anywhere in the world.
Despite these benefits, it is true that excessive use of computers can have negative effects on our health and well-being. Therefore, it is essential for individuals to maintain a balance between their computer usage and other activities in life. By doing so, we can enjoy all the advantages that technology offers while still taking care of ourselves physically and mentally.
In conclusion, computers do benefit society by expanding our knowledge, improving communication, and increasing productivity. However, it is crucial for people to use them responsibly and maintain a balance between their digital and natural lives. I hope the readers will agree with me on this opinion.
Sincerely, 
[Your Name]
