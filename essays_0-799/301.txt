 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my personal view on the impact of computers on society. While it is undeniable that technology has advanced dramatically over the years, allowing us to connect with people across the globe and access vast amounts of information at our fingertips, I believe that there are some negative consequences as well.

For one, computers have made many individuals more sedentary than ever before. With the rise of social media and online gaming, people are spending more time sitting in front of their screens than engaging in physical activities or interacting with others face-to-face. This can lead to a host of health problems such as obesity, poor posture, and eye strain.

Additionally, the widespread use of computers has led to an increasingly isolated society. While technology allows us to connect with others instantly, it also creates barriers between individuals who are more focused on their screens than on those around them. This lack of social interaction can contribute to feelings of loneliness and disconnection, particularly among children and teenagers.

In conclusion, while computers have brought many benefits to society, such as increased productivity and global connectivity, we must be mindful of the potential drawbacks. By taking a balanced approach to our use of technology, we can ensure that it enhances rather than hinders our lives and relationships.

Thank you for considering my opinion on this important matter.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
