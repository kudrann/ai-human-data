 Dear Editor,

I am writing this letter to express my opinion on the effects of computers on society. As technology advances and more people use computers, it is essential to evaluate whether these advancements benefit us or not. I believe that computers have a positive impact on our lives in many ways.

Firstly, computers teach hand-eye coordination. Many games and programs require players to move their hands quickly and accurately, which improves their ability to respond to visual stimuli. This skill is useful in various aspects of life, such as driving or playing sports.

Secondly, computers allow people to learn about faraway places and cultures. With the internet, anyone can access information about different countries and their customs. This knowledge helps us understand and respect other cultures, promoting tolerance and cooperation among people worldwide.

Lastly, computers enable online communication. People can now talk to others around the globe instantly, making the world feel smaller and more connected. Social media platforms allow friends and family members to keep in touch easily, even if they live far apart.

However, some experts argue that people spend too much time on their computers and less time exercising, enjoying nature, and interacting with family and friends. While this may be true for some individuals, it is essential to remember that moderation is key. People should balance their computer use with other activities in life to maintain a healthy lifestyle.

In conclusion, I believe that computers have positive effects on society. They teach hand-eye coordination, provide access to information about different cultures, and enable online communication. It is crucial for people to maintain a balance between computer use and other activities in life to ensure they lead healthy lives.

Sincerely,
[Your Name]
